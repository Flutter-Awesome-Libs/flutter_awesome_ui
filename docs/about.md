title: What is Flutter Awesome UI?

---

This is a collection of widgets that are commonly used across different types of applications.

We often noticed that when we were building applications in flutter we would end up creating a lot of common widgets for every application, not only does this consume time that we could have used somewhere else it also adds a lot of duplication of code across apps and when we needed to change one we had to make the same change in many places.

To solve this problem we cam up with an idea of creating a bunch of reusable widgets that we could use in our applications with a design pattern that would fit a lot of different applications, thus was born Flutter Awesome UI.

It is still very early days and a lot of widgets are undergoing planning and will move into active development as and when we can work on them. If you have an idea for a widget that you think can be useful, simply create a feature request on any of our [Github](https://github.com/Flutter-Awesome-Libs) repositories, this helps us know what users want and expect from us and helps us prioritize work.
